This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The objective is to build a responsive admin dashboard using CSS Grid Layout.

## Project Overview

The Admin Dashboard project focuses on:

- Utilizing CSS Grid Layout for complex, two-dimensional layouts.
- Structuring HTML elements for a sidebar, header, and main content areas.
- Nesting grid containers to create intricate layouts within sections.
- Incorporating external assets like icons and fonts to enhance design.

## Features

- **Modular Sections:** Includes a sidebar for navigation, a header for user interactions, and a main content area for displaying information.
- **Customizable Design:** Easily change colors, fonts, and icons to fit your preferences.
